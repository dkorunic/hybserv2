# This script will remove all backup directories created
# from past months. Directories created in the current month
# will not be touched. The idea is to keep the backup
# directory looking neat, instead of having hundreds of
# different directories with similar database backups :-)
#
# Usage: ./cleandb [[ -h | --help ] | [[ -c | --confirm]
# [backup-directory]]]
#
# The --confirm option will cause the script to ask for
# confirmation for each directory being deleted.

# Set this to the default backup directory
