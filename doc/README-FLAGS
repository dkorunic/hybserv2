These are the flags you may give users in the config file.
Format: O:user@host:password:Nickname:<flags>

Example: O:*wnder@*underworld.net:NotaRealPass:SideWnder:sgj

Available flags:

a    -     Administrator - combination of "f", "o", and "d" 
           flags. Many more commands are available (.help)

d    -     Allows user to use DCC CHAT service.  If OpersOnlyDcc
           is enabled, and the user doesn't have an "o" flag,
           they won't be allowed to use DCC CHAT.

e    -     Exception flag - Any user with this flag will not
           be KILLed or GLINEd by Hybserv if someone attempts 
           to do so.

f    -     "Friend" - when an administrator SECUREs a channel,
           "f" users will be opped if they are registered at
           the time.

g    -     Gives user gline privileges, allowing them
           the use of the GLINE and UNGLINE commands.

j    -     Allows user to JUPE and UNJUPE servers

o    -     Normal Operator - automatic "f" flag. Many more
           commands are available (.help)

s    -     Services Administrator - most powerful flag. This
           flag is a combination of every other flag (except +j
           and +g), and it also gives you access to the most
           powerful OperServ commands - use sparingly.

** Note: Anyone with a O: line may use the IDENTIFY and HELP commands
         no matter what flags they have.
