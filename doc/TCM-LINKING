TCM (TexasNet Connection Monitor) bot linking

	First of all, you may obtain a copy of the TCM bot from
		http://www.db.net/~db/tcm.html

	A TCM bot is a program that connects to your server as a client
and monitors clones, flooders, etc.  It must be opered in order
to kline clones and flooders.

	A useful feature of TCM is linking, similarly to eggdrop's linking
feature.  I've tried to make Hybserv compatible with TCM for linking
purposes so you may connect Hybserv to your TCM botnet.

	Once you download TCM and compile it, you will need to edit it's
user file (userlist.cf) to give Hybserv access to link to it.  You will
probably want to add both a C: and an N: line for Hybserv.  For example,
if the hostname Hybserv is running on is services.us, your C: and N: 
lines would look something like this:

		C:services.us:Hybserv:Password:6800
		N:*services.us:Hybserv:Password:OKB

	Also, you must modify hybserv.conf to let Hybserv know about the TCM
bot(s) you wish to link.  If a TCM's host is mybot.com, your linking
lines would look something like this:

		B:mybot.com:TcmNick:Password:6800
		L:*mybot.com:TcmNick:Password

	Once you have Hybserv and the TCM running with the userfiles set up,
you can link them in one of two ways.  You can either /dcc chat Hybserv
and type ".link TcmNick", or you could /dcc chat the TCM bot, and type
".tcmconn Hybserv".  Then, hopefully the two will link.

	If both TCM and Hybserv are located on same server, you can remap
port in either one to 6801 using DefaultTcmPort directive in Hybserv
(settings.conf) or P: directive in TCM (tcm.cf).

	Important Note:  tcm 3.0.1 and higher do NOT support linking.

	If you have any questions, or bugs to report, please email 
wnder@underworld.net.  Thank you.
