Syntax: %bSET <nickname> MASTER <nickname>%b

Resets the master nickname for your nickname link to
<nickname>. The master nickname contains the %bACCESS%b
list for the entire link, and all other nicknames in
the link are aliased to the master nickname. In order
to change the master nickname, <nickname> must already
be in the nickname link (through the %bLINK%b command).
Example:
        %b/msg %N SET nick MASTER MainNick%b
          Sets the new master to "MainNick".
