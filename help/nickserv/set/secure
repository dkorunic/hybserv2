Syntax: %bSET <nickname> SECURE {ON|OFF}%b

If %bSECURE%b is ON, clients that use your nickname
will be required to %bIDENTIFY%b regardless of
whether they match a hostmask on your %bACCESS%b
list.  Also, if someone tries to %bRECOVER%b/%bRELEASE%b
your nickname, they will need to supply the correct
password regardless of matching a hostmask on your
ACCESS list.  When %bSECURE%b is OFF, clients
that use your nickname will not be killed, if they
do not IDENTIFY, but they will not be allowed to
execute %N commands without first IDENTIFY'ing.
Note that settings should be usually applied to
%bmaster%b nickname.
