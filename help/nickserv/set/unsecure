Syntax: %bSET <nickname> UNSECURE {ON|OFF}%b

If UNSECURE is ON, clients using your nickname will not be
required to %bIDENTIFY%b in order to execute %N
commands, as long as they match a hostmask on your
%bACCESS%b list. This is not recommended.
Note that settings should be usually applied to
%bmaster%b nickname.
